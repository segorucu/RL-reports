# RL-reports
The reports for the Reinforcement Learning Class:


Report 1: Duplicates the results from the following paper:
R. Sutton, “Learning to Predict by the Method of Temporal Differences” Machine Learning, vol. 3, pp. 9-44, 1988.


Report 2: Implementation for Deep Q-Networks.

Report 3: I implement DQN, Ape-X, A3C
and Reward Shaping by using Ray’s Rllib library; and compare
and contrast them with the already implemented 3 PPO agents.

P.S. Please contact me for the codes.
